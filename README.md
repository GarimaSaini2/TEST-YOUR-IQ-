Introduction In today's fast-paced world, mental sharpness and cognitive abilities play a crucial role in personal and professional success. Understanding one's intellectual strengths and weaknesses can provide valuable insights for self-improvement and career planning. With the widespread adoption of smartphones, leveraging mobile applications to facilitate cognitive assessments has become increasingly accessible and convenient.

The primary objective of the "Test Your IQ" application is to provide users with a reliable and user-friendly tool to assess their intellectual capabilities. Whether for personal growth, academic pursuits, or professional development, this app aims to deliver accurate and meaningful results that users can trust.

In this project, we will delve into the development process of the "Test Your IQ" application, covering everything from conceptualization and design to implementation and testing. Our goal is to create an intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and highly functional app that stands out in the competitive landscape of educational and cognitive assessment tools.
